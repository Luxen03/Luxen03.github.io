## How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion
- **Application of Concepts Taught:**
    I manually typed HTML tags and used div to seperate groups, I used the id parameter for reference later in CSS and javascript. I used selectors on div classes and existing tags like button and body to format the style of HTML tags. I aligned the center to the center of the screen in a column direction, this way all other div groups would follow under the logo. I used responsiveness to tell the user whether or not her screen is big enough to fit the website in its reccomended size. I also added animations to the elements on startup.
- **Design:**
    I added a collage of pictures from my most previous projects to make the website look more than just text. I also added a resume for easy lookup. I made the colors match the colors I most often use on my projects. I also gave the logo and buttons shadow animations on startup although not as visible to the dark background.
- **Content:**
    At first I had the HTML and CSS files seperated, but with the help of sir Ilao's teachings, I was able to use that knowledge to compress it all into one file for easy access. The page consists of an ABOUT ME page which holds information that could prove useful in looking into what kind of person I am and what I am capable of. The PROJECT page features a collage of some of my most recent works.
- **Creativity:**
    at first I tried adding transitions to everything, but since I did not know how to make button animate other objects, I was forced to let them just abruptly appear. I did however manage to add transitions on startup. I thought that this website could prove useful to me in technopreneurship so I made it with that in mind. I made a logo to make the page look more sleek but captivating, however, I did not have enough information that could help catch the viewers' attention any more than this.
- **Deployment:**
    The website itself is compressed into one file found in my repository.
## Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
- I have learned a bit of HTML back on my junior high school days, but it was a first for me to learn more about how to connect CSS into our HTML files, and what it is capable of, I have also learned how to make my website look more fluid rather than a static page.
## Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
- While I completely understand how to you aligning, justifying, and flexbox methods to form a grid for our website, it still confuses me on how sometimes the elements wont align themselves despite me having tried every method to align them, so I had to search google different ways to realign some of my elements.
## How you could improve your website in the future
- Once I learn how to add transitions to other elements on the click of a button, I plan to make my website even more full of content and way more fluid that it is as of now.
## Other thoughts that might be noteworthy
- All art was done by me, no plagiarism was done.
